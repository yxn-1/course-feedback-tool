# Course Feedback Tool

A small full-stack learning support application designed to demonstrate
Python backend development, JavaScript frontend integration, relational
data modeling, testing, and documentation practices.

This project is intentionally built without direct access to vendor LMS
systems and instead follows public integration patterns commonly used
in university learning technology environments.

## Tech Stack (Planned)
- Backend: Python (FastAPI)
- Frontend: JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Database: SQLite (PostgreSQL-ready)
- Version Control: Git

## Status
Project setup and planning.
